            <p class="card__text">When working on a large-scale web development project, it’s essential to have a consistent and 
                organized approach for styling. The BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming standard is one well-liked way to accomplish 
                this. <br> The term BEM stands for Block-Element-Modifier, which is a naming convention for CSS class names that 
                helps to maintain a clear and consistent structure in a project’s styling.  <br>
                In this article, we’ll take a closer look at BEM.</p> 
            <p class="card__text2" >  The BEM Convention: BEM uses block, element, and modifier names to construct CSS class names, 
                    separated by double underscores (__) and hyphens (-). <br> It is based on the idea of breaking down a web page into 
                    smaller, reusable blocks of code. <br> Each block consists of elements and modifiers that can be used to create
                     variations of that block.  <br>This approach makes it easy to understand the purpose of each class and how they
                      relate to each other. <br>
                     It allows developers to quickly understand the structure of a project’s styling and make changes effectively. <br></p>
            <h2 class="card__title2">Ways To Implement BEM </h2>
                     <p class="card__text3">
                        1. Start by defining the block: A block should be represented by a single CSS class and should be prefixed with the block name, such as “header”, “button”, or “form”. <br>
                        2. Identify the elements within the block: The elements are the parts of the block that make it up. Elements should be represented by a single CSS class and should be prefixed with the block name, followed by two underscores, and then the element name, such as “header_logo”. <br>
                        3. Define the modifiers: Modifiers should be represented by a single CSS class and should be prefixed with the block or element name, followed by two dashes, and then the modifier name, such as “button–primary”. <br>
                       4. Apply the BEM naming convention to your CSS classes: Once you’ve defined your blocks, elements, and modifiers, you should apply the BEM naming convention to your CSS classes. <br>
                       5. Use the BEM classes in your HTML: Once you’ve defined your BEM classes, you should use them in your HTML to apply the appropriate styles to your elements. You should use the block class on the top-level element, the element class on the child elements, and the modifier class on any elements that need to be modified. <br>
                       6. Keep the structure consistent: Be consistent with the structure and conventions you have chosen throughout your project, it will make it easier for other developers to understand and work with the codebase.  <br>
                        7.Reuse the classes: Reuse the classes as much as possible to keep consistency in the design and to reduce the amount of code. <br> </p>
